Design Patterns are common architectural approaches.

They are used principally with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they are
useful in all language programming, defining them universally relevant.

We can organize design patterns in 3 sets:

1. Creational
    Builder
    Factories
        - Abstract Factory
        - Factory Method
    Prototype
    Singleton

2. Structural
    Adapter
    Bridge
    Composite
    Decorator
    Fa√ßade
    Flyweight
    Proxy

3. Behavioral
    Chain of Responsibility
    Command
    Interpreter
    Iterator
    Mediator
    Memento
    Observer
    State
    Strategy
    Template Method
    Visitor
