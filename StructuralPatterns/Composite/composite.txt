The goal of the Composite design pattern is to treat individual components
and groups of objects in a uniform manner, so to provide an identical interface
over both aggregates of componentes and individual components.

Composite patters allow us to create compound objects. For example, a Person
class (object) can have a name (individual component) and an address (represented
by another class - aggregates of components).
