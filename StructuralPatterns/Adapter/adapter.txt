The Adapter pattern is a simple design that tries to adapt the interface that
you are given to the interface that you actually need.

To make a similitude, the pattern is similar to the travel power socket where we
have different plug type. In fact, we cannot modify our electrical gadgets
(with a predefined interface), but the socket (adapter design) makes the job.

So an Adapter is an 'in-between component' that allow us to reuse given
interfaces with new ones.
