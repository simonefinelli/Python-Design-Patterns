In real word applications, real complicated objects are never designed from scratch.
So, we look at what is already done and make improves the existing structures.

The Prototype design pattern goes in the same above consept: the idea is that we
have already got some of existing design, and we want ot make a copy of that,
customizing it and then start using it.
Note that the existing design can be partially or fully constructed. We have simply
made a copy of the prototype (already existing design) to customize it.

To copy (clone) the existing design we can use a Factory design. For example, we
can build a prototype factory with few pre-defined designs, and then we could ask
the Factory to customize the that designs.
