In this category we have two kind of Factories: Factory Method and Abstract
Factory.

But before we start with the cose, why de we need Factories?
Sometimes object creation logic becomes a bit too convoluted: initializers could
get longer and longer and more sophisticated, and we might want to move this
logic somewhere.
In this case, however, we create a whole object (unlike Builder).

To outsourcing the process of the creation of an object (complicated enough) we:
- need a separated method: the Factory Method. It typically is a static method;
- move the Factory Method to a separate class (Factory);
- possibility of create hierarchy of factories with an Abstract Factory.
