We know that some objects are simple and can be created in a single initialization
call.

Sometimes, we encounter more complicated objects which required a lot of stages
to create them. Also, having an object with 10 initializer args is not productive.
So, what we do is opt for a piecewise construction: instead of getting the entire
object initialized with one big call, we call different methods of a special component
called builder.
A builder, therefore, is a component which constructs the object step by step.

Formal Definition: When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide
an API for doing it succinctly.
